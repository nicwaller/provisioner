## Running Integration Tests

macOS - install Vagrant if you want to run tests
(to avoid polluting other EC2 environmnets)

And VirtualBox

This could be simpler with Vagrant, but I'm working on an M1/aarch64 machine.

- EC2 probably works better for M1
- Vagrant does not play nice with M1
- You should have AWS credentials (ie. using `aws configure`)
